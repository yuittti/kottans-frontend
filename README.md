### Remote Phase

#### 1. Git and GitHub
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

Good basics of using Git and GitHub, but mostly nothing new for me, as I had an experience with Git before.
But couple of things were quite new and might be useful:
- `git log --stat` to see in the log which files were changed
- `git log --graph --oneline` for the short log 
- use 'q' key to exit git log and git diff (instead of Ctrl + Z)
- forking the repositories

#### 2. Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md)

#### Learn command line
I like such interactive courses were you are receiving the knowledges and you are practicing in the same time and you are remembering information by repeating simple things many times. I didn't expect to see in this course the new things, but I was surprised that I found some. I am not sure if I will use all of them often in future, but some of them seems to be pretty useful. So for me the information below was definetly new:
- options for `ls` command, especially `-t` for sorting by date
- using the `mv` command for renaming files
- `cat` with `>>` to add content to existing file
- the pipes `|` for combining different commands
- command `sort`
- command `uniq` to filter duplicated lines in the output
- command `sed` for replacing strings in the output
- command `history` to list the terminal history
- command `grep` - it wasn't new at all for me, but the shown way of its using is interesting as well

#### HTTP
Both articles are very informative. This is a really well structured information about basics knowledge of how does the HTTP protocol works under the hood. 

I liked the thesis 
> *HTTP is an application layer protocol over TCP, which is over IP* 

which does explain a lot about communication between server and client. 

Also it was nice to read in one place all the information about:
- types of existing requests, 
- responses status codes, 
- types of request and response headers

The most interesting part of 2nd article was about basics of identification and authentication processes, but would be nice to dive deeper in this part.
