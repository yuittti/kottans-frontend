### Remote Phase

#### 1. Git and GitHub
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

Good basics of using Git and GitHub, but mostly nothing new for me, as I had an experience with Git before.
But couple of things were quite new and might be useful:
- `git log --stat` to see in the log which files were changed
- `git log --graph --oneline` for the short log 
- use 'q' key to exit git log and git diff (instead of Ctrl + Z)
- forking the repositories
